    <Rave 
        amount="500" 
        country="NG" 
        currency="NGN" 
        email="test@mail.com" 
        firstname="Oluwole" 
        lastname="Adebiyi" 
        publickey="FLWPUBK-**************************-X" 
        secretkey="FLWSECK-**************************-X"
        paymenttype="card" // or set to both for card and account transactions
        page="card"
        meta={[{ metaname: "color", metavalue: "red" }, { metaname: "storelocation", metavalue: "ikeja" }]}
        production={false} 
        onSuccess={res => this.onSuccess(res)} 
        onFailure={e => this.onFailure(e)}
        />
  );
}
```

        paymenttype="mpesa" // or set to both for card and mpesa transactions
        page="mpesa"
        meta={[{ metaname: "color", metavalue: "red" }, { metaname: "storelocation", metavalue: "ikeja" }]}
        production={false} 
        onSuccess={res => this.onSuccess(res)} 
        onFailure={e => this.onFailure(e)}
        />
